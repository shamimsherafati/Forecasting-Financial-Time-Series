The goal of this project is to use time series analysis techniques to create a forecasting model for two stocks, TSLA and AMZN. The objective is to develop a model that correctly forecasts future stock values so that investors may make wise selections. To do this, we created forecasting models utilising historical stock price data for TSLA and AMZN, which we gathered from Yahoo Finance for the last 12 months using Python in a Jupyter notebook (252 market days). To build these models, we employed a number of techniques, such as moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA
